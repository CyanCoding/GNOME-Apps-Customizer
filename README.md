# GNOME Apps Customizer
_This app is an extension of my [AppAdder](https://github.com/CyanCoding/AppAdder) program that allows you to easily create app icons on your desktop. The two apps will be merged together soon._

The GNOME Apps Customizer lets you take full control over your desktop. It creates a list of every app in your App Overview and lets you customize each one individually. The program reads and modifies the `.desktop` application files and even allows for creating new apps/scripts on your desktop (with the help of [AppAdder](https://github.com/CyanCoding/AppAdder)). Think of it as an all-in-one for app management!

Check out some of the creative uses and visions for the program below.

## Examples
**Issue:** You have the app called _P3X OneNote_, but you just want it to be called _OneNote_.
<br>**Fix:** The GNOME Apps Customizer allows you to change the name of apps on your desktop.


<br>**Issue:** One of your apps doesn't have an icon.
<br>**Fix:** With this program, you can add your own custom icons for each app.


<br>**Issue:** You moved the application files of a program and now clicking on the app no longer works.
<br>**Fix:** You can fix that with this program by changing the execution path.


<br>**Issue:** You want to rearrange your GNOME favorites/apps overview quickly.
<br>**Fix:** The GNOME Apps Customizer will let you rearrange the app order and change the sort.

_All that and so much more!_

## Installation
We just started working on this a few days ago, so it isn't ready for the public yet. Stay tuned, and expect the first version to be released sometime in June, 2021. Once the app is complete, it will be packaged as a `.AppImage` and `.deb`.
